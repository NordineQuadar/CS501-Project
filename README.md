#  Project Scope:
The main goal of this project is to perform advanced analysis on product reviews using data analystics methods and machine learning algorithms. Amazon product reveiws will be used as a case study. The final outcomes of this project are:
- Perform data cleaning. 
- Apply some data exploration methods to get some initial insights about the data.
- Train a classifier model to perform sentimental analysis.
- Use pretrained deep learning model (Bert) to perform sentimental analysis.
- Compare both methods. 
- Extract usefull insights from the sentimental analysis to help understading the quality/issues/satisfaction of a specific product.
- If time permit, a QA method will be used to help users quickly explore/search information in reveiews of specific product.
