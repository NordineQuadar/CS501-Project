#  Project Scope:

The main goal of this project is to perform advanced analysis on product reviews using data analytics methods and machine learning algorithms. Amazon product reviews will be used as a case study. The final outcomes of this project are:

Perform data cleaning.

1. Apply some data exploration methods to get some initial insights about the data.
2. Train a classifier model to perform sentimental analysis.
3. Use pre-trained deep learning model (Bert) to perform sentimental analysis.
4. Compare both methods.
5. Extract useful insights from the sentimental analysis to help understand the quality/issues/satisfaction of a specific product.
6. If time permits, a QA method will be used to help users quickly explore/search information in reviews of a specific product.
